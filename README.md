# States-Guessing-Game-Python


# Summary:

By working with this code, I learned how to use the turtle module to create graphics and build interactive applications in Python. Reading and navigating documentation on stack overflow and pyhton documentation. I gained experience using the pandas library for manipulating data and reading/writing CSV files. The code helped me understand basic control structures like loops (while) and conditionals (if). I also learned how to handle user inputs dynamically using turtle.Screen methods. Managing lists and using list comprehensions to process data became clearer. Plus, I got hands-on experience with basic debugging and working with console output in Python.

# Topics learned:

**Turtle module:**
- Create a window using `Screen()`.
- Get user input with `textinput()`.
- Display custom images using `addshape()` and `shape()`.
- Create and control a turtle object with `Turtle()` to draw or write on the screen.
- Move the turtle to specific locations using `goto()`.
- Write text where the turtle is positioned using `write()`.
- Hide the turtle cursor with `hideturtle()`.
- Move the turtle without drawing using `penup()`.

**Pandas module:**
- Read data from a CSV file with `read_csv()`.
- Work with tabular data in rows and columns.
- Convert a column to a list using `to_list()`.
- Save modified data back to a CSV file with `to_csv()`.

**Python built-in features:**
- Use list comprehensions to filter data, like `[state for state in all_states if state not in guesses]`.
- Use loops and if-conditions to control the program flow (`while`, `if`).
- Modify text to capitalize each word with `.title()`.

# Game:

When first running the game, the map is displayed, and the pop up asking you to enter the name of the a state comes up automaticly. Allowing you to instantly start typing.

Enter as many states you can remember.

The pop up will return after entering any input, only allowing correct input onto the map.

Once the user is done type "End" for the game to end. Game will close and your score will be printed in the consol.

Also a new CSV file will be created. The new list will be all the states not guessed.

# Conclusion:

This is a very fun game to test someones knowledge of the States of America. But this process showed many basics to python and what you can create with just a couple of modules. Main thing learned is how to navigate documentation. Documentation is the key to building anything you can think of.
