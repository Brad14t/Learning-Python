# Learning-Python
Projects done while learning Python.

# Summary:

By working with this code, I learned how to use the turtle module to create graphics and build interactive applications in Python. I gained experience using the pandas library for manipulating data and reading/writing CSV files. The code helped me understand basic control structures like loops (while) and conditionals (if). I also learned how to handle user inputs dynamically using turtle.Screen methods. Managing lists and using list comprehensions to process data became clearer. Plus, I got hands-on experience with basic debugging and working with console output in Python.

# Topics learned:

**Turtle module:**
- Create a window using `Screen()`.
- Get user input with `textinput()`.
- Display custom images using `addshape()` and `shape()`.
- Create and control a turtle object with `Turtle()` to draw or write on the screen.
- Move the turtle to specific locations using `goto()`.
- Write text where the turtle is positioned using `write()`.
- Hide the turtle cursor with `hideturtle()`.
- Move the turtle without drawing using `penup()`.

**Pandas module:**
- Read data from a CSV file with `read_csv()`.
- Work with tabular data in rows and columns.
- Convert a column to a list using `to_list()`.
- Save modified data back to a CSV file with `to_csv()`.

**Python built-in features:**
- Use list comprehensions to filter data, like `[state for state in all_states if state not in guesses]`.
- Use loops and if-conditions to control the program flow (`while`, `if`).
- Modify text to capitalize each word with `.title()`.
